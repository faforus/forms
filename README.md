I am currently involved in a group project where I have taken up the responsibility of developing the front-end. The back-end is being handled by a highly experienced Tech Lead who is also responsible for managing the project, ensuring that it follows industry-standard practices, leveraging tools such as GitLab for version control, task assignment, branching, and code review.

The objective of this project is to create a professional website catering to individuals seeking specialized 'agents'. Users will be able to provide their information through a comprehensive customer form on the website. Based on specific criteria, the system will assign them a suitable agent. The project encompasses a complex customer form, an admin panel for managing customer data, and an agent panel with secure authentication.

Awaiting full documentation, I have made a front-end skeleton with the implementation of a multi-page Redux form for clients. Although this is an early draft, it serves as the foundation for capturing user information and managing the state. Additionally, I have also begun developing an agent registration form using the Formik library, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience for agent registration.
